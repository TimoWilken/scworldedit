# Survivalcraft world visualiser

This collection of scripts extracts data from Survivalcraft worlds and visualises them.

The scripts are designed to be used in succession. First, extract data into a CSV table using `chunks.py`, then process that table using `visualise.py` to generate a heatmap from the data.

Use each script's `--help` option to see usage information.
